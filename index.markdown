Hello!

I'm Jason, and I am a recent graduate of the University of Colorado Boulder with a B.S. in Computer Science. 

This here is my WIP personal portfolio website, If you happen to have made it here, I'm not sure how, but welcome!

I am passionate about software development, roller hockey, dancing, and tea :)
